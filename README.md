# Bank Risk Controller Systems

## Overview
This project develops a predictive model to assess loan default risk, assisting banks in informed lending decisions. The model is deployed as a Streamlit web app for interactive use.

## Key Skills and Tools
- Python, Analytics, Statistics
- Data Visualization (Plotly, Seaborn)
- Streamlit, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

## Problem Statement
Predict customer loan defaults using historical loan data with the target variable "TARGET".

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Selection & Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Model Deployment**

## Expected Deliverables
- Source Code
- Trained Model Files
- Streamlit Dashboard

## Data Set
- **Loan Data:** [Loan_data.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10O0mhM9FCBKeFpIGuJprgDtzJxpEArdx?usp=sharing)
- **Data Dictionary:** [Data_dictionary.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10O0mhM9FCBKeFpIGuJprgDtzJxpEArdx?usp=sharing)

## Evaluation Metrics
